The NetKAN consists of CKAN fragments which are used by our indexing bots to generate metadata for use by the CKAN client and other tools. The files themselves live [in the NetKAN directory](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/NetKAN/tree/master/NetKAN).

Contributing to the NetKAN is the preferred way to add CKAN support for a mod, as it needs only be done once, and our bots will automatically pick up new releaes.  This is the preferred way to index CKAN mods. The files themselves live inside the `NetKAN` folder.

The format of NetKAN file is that described in the [CKAN Spec](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/blob/master/Spec.md), *including* the special use fields at the end.

To inflate a NetKAN file into a CKAN file, simply give it as an argument to the [`netkan.exe`](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases) executable. The same executable works on all systems (Mac/Linux/Windows), and requires mono 4.0 to run.
